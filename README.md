# 🧩 Final Back-End Project - 4Geeks Academy España

This was the last Back-End project at **4Geeks Academy España** 🚀  
A full-stack challenge that combined **Front-end and Back-end** development to build a complete authentication system using **React.js** and **Flask** 👾

---

## 🔐 Authentication System

This project includes a complete user flow:

- ✅ **Signup**: Create an account with email and password  
- 🔐 **Login**: Secure authentication using **JWT**  
- 🎯 **Logout**: Clears token and redirects to login page  
- 🛢️ **Database Management** with **SQLAlchemy**  
- 🗂️ **Token Storage** in the Front-end using **LocalStorage**

---

## 🔄 Refresh Token Flow

To improve user experience, a **refresh token mechanism** was implemented:  
If the access token expires, a new one is automatically requested — no need for users to log in again manually.

---

## 🔒 Protected Routes

Once authenticated, users can:

- Access **private routes**
- View **protected information** validated by token
- Be redirected to login if the token is invalid or missing

---

## 🏫 Bonus: 4Geeks Campus Page (Simplified)

As a visual bonus 🏆, a simplified version of the **4Geeks Academy campus page** was recreated using **React**, including images to make the UI more engaging and user-friendly.

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

This project helped deepen knowledge in:

- User authentication and session flows
- Security with JWT
- Integration of Frontend and Backend using **React & Flask**
- Database interactions with **SQLAlchemy**
- **Refresh Token** implementation
- Protecting routes and managing authentication states on the client
